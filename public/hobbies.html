                    <li>Listening to Music <br />
                        I love to listen to many kinds of music and to analyze songwritings. I also have a two person "club" with one of my best friends where we listen to different albums and react to them. Here is the <a href="https://robinnuwu.tumblr.com/">link</a> to our website where we publish our progress.

                    <li>Playing the Clarinet <br />
                        I have played the clarinet in my high school's orchestra for five years. This experience taught me a lot in terms of instrument playing and teamwork-how to excel not individually but as a whole group. <br />
                        We have given many concerts all accross Ankara and all of them were excellent.

                        Although I don't do it professionally, the only sport I am slightly talented is swimming.
